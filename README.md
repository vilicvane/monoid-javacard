A JavaCard with Monoid applets installed is:

- [x] A hardware crypto wallet.
- [ ] A FIDO2 authenticator.
- [ ] A One-Time Password (OTP) generator.
- [ ] A Tesla key.

The goal is to allow third-party Monoid applets to interact with _Monoid Applet_ `Shareable` interface for signing/verifying and data access, so that Monoid can manage those keys and data and make it easy for users to backup, restore or even synchronize securely with unified UX.

## Requirements

JavaCard 3.0.5 with ECC support is required.

See [cards](doc/cards.md) for links to vendors.

## Build & Install

For vscode-based editor, please install the recommended Java extensions pack curated by Microsoft and create symlink `.jdk` to your JDK 11 installation, e.g.:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/jdk-11 .jdk
```

For other editors or terminals, please ensure related configurations accordingly.

Now we can build the project with Gradle:

```sh
./gradlew buildJavaCard
```

Then install applets to a card with [gp] command:

```sh
gp --install build/javacard/monoidsafe.cap
gp --install build/javacard/monoid.cap
```

> The gradle plugin task `./gradlew installJavaCard` will try to append multiple `--install` options to `gp` command, which is not supported in my case. So we have to do it manually.

## Development

The development workflow requires Node.js for source code housekeeping and some test case validation.

```sh
npm install
```

Run tests with simulator:

```sh
./gradlew test --info --rerun-tasks
```

Run tests on physical cards:

```sh
# requires a clean installation:
# gp --uninstall build/javacard/monoid.cap
# gp --uninstall build/javacard/monoidsafe.cap

gp --install build/javacard/monoidsafe.cap
gp --install build/javacard/monoid.cap
```

```sh
CARD_TYPE=physical ./gradlew test --info --rerun-tasks
```

Commands to run:

```sh
# sync some constants like AIDs (and more) across files.
npx inplate --update

# format code with prettier. YES!!!
npx prettier --write .
```

## Architecture

The _Monoid Applet_ stores the safe PIN required by _Monoid Safe Applet_. When it has the safe PIN, the safe is considered **unlocked**, meaning:

1. _Monoid Applet_ itself can access the safe freely (commands probably have their own authentication requirements though).
2. Applets with granted permissions can interact (sign/verify) with keys and access data in _Monoid Safe Applet_ (via _Monoid Applet_).

See [architecture](doc/architecture.md) for more details.

## ISO-7816 Commands

_Monoid Applet_ uses a minimal CBOR-based RPC protocol.

### Command authentication

The authentication is done within a session, using `0x21` command.

- Access PIN: for commands that would not result in keys/data revealed.
- Safe PIN: for commands that could result in keys/data revealed, or commands that requires access PIN.

### `0x20` ~ `0x2F` System management

#### `0x20` Hello

```ts
type Request = {};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  version: number;
  /** A 4-byte random id generated on _Monoid Applet_ installation. */
  id: byte[];
  features: {
    curves: string[];
    ciphers: string[];
  };
  /** Tries remaining for the PIN, or `false` if the PIN is not set. */
  pin: number | false;
  safe: {
    /** A 4-byte random id generated on _Monoid Safe Applet_ installation. */
    id: byte[];
    /** Tries remaining for the PIN, or `false` if the PIN is not set. */
    pin: number | false;
    /** Whether the safe is unlocked (i.e., Monoid Applet stores a validated safe PIN). */
    unlocked: boolean;
  };
};
```

### `0x21` Authenticate

```ts
type Request = {
  auth: {
    pin: string;
    safe?: true;
  };
};
```

```ts
type Response = {};
```

#### `0x22` Set PIN

> Requires authentication with safe PIN if it is set.

```ts
type Request = {
  pin: string;
  safe?: true;
};
```

```ts
type Response = {};
```

> In case of _Monoid Applet_ reinstallation resulting in its losing the safe PIN, setting safe PIN again (to either the same or a different PIN) will restore the safe PIN stored in _Monoid Applet_ (thus "unlocking" the safe).

#### `0x2F` System information

```ts
type Request = {};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  versions: {
    monoid: number;
    javacard: [number, number];
  };
  memories: {
    persistent: {
      available: number;
    };
    transient: {
      reset: {
        available: number;
      };
      deselect: {
        available: number;
      };
    };
  };
  features: {
    curves: string[];
    ciphers: string[];
  };
};
```

### `0x30` ~ `0x3F` Safe management

```ts
type SafeItemKeyType = 'entropy' | 'seed' | 'master' | 'secp256k1';
type SafeItemType = SafeItemKeyType | byte;
```

#### `0x30` List items

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  type?: SafeItemType;
};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  items: {
    index: byte[];
    type: SafeItemType;
    alias?: string;
  }[];
};
```

#### `0x31` View

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  index: byte[];
};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  alias?: string;
};
```

#### `0x32` Get item

> Requires authentication with safe PIN.

```ts
type Request = {
  index: byte[];
};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  alias?: string;
  data: byte[];
};
```

#### `0x33` Set item

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  index: byte[];
  alias?: byte[];
  data?: byte[];
};
```

```ts
type Response = {};
```

#### `0x34` Create item

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  (
    | {
        type: SafeItemType;
      }
    | {
        index: byte[];
      }
  ) & {
    alias?: byte[];
    data: byte[];
  };
```

```ts
type Response = {
  index: byte[];
};
```

#### `0x35` Remove item

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  index: byte[];
};
```

```ts
type Response = {};
```

#### `0x38` Create random key

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = {
  type: SafeItemKeyType;
};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  index: byte[];
};
```

### `0x40` ~ `0x4F` Key usage

```ts
type Key = {
  index: byte[];
} & (
  | {
      // seed
      seed: string;
      curve: string;
      path: byte[];
    }
  | {
      // master
      curve: string;
      path: byte[];
    }
  | {
      // key
    }
);
```

#### `0x40` View key

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = Key;
```

```ts
type Response = {
  publicKey: byte[];
} & (
  | {
      // seed / master
      chainCode: byte[];
    }
  | {
      // key
    }
);
```

#### `0x41` Sign

> Requires authentication.

```ts
type Request = Key & {
  cipher: string;
  digest: byte[];
};
```

```ts
type Response = {
  signature: byte[];
};
```

## Index

A safe item index is a 2 + 8 bytes array.

The first 2 bytes are the type of the item (`0x0000` to `0x0FFF` and `0xFFFF` are reserved), and the remaining 8 bytes are unique per item, typically 8-byte digest of the data if immutable:

- `0x00` Monoid applet data (draft, not implemented yet)
  - `0x0001` Third-party applet permission data
    - +8 bytes digest of third-party AID
- `0x01` `"entropy"` Entropy
  - +1 byte entropy length
  - +8 bytes digest of entropy
- `0x02` `"seed"` Seed key
  - +1 byte seed length
  - +8 bytes digest of seed
- `0x03` `"master"` Master key
  - +1 byte master key length (note data length is master key length \* 2)
  - +8 bytes digest of master key
- `0x04` EC key
  - `0x0401` `"secp256k1"` SECP256K1 key
    - +8 bytes digest of key
- `0x0FFF` Generic data (draft, not implemented yet)
  - +8 bytes unique identifier

## Credits

Monoid JavaCard is a [javacard-gradle-template] fork, which uses projects like [javacard-gradle-plugin] and [ant-javacard] under the hood.

As this is my first JavaCard project, it would not be possible without great open-source works like these. ðŸŽ‰

Especially, during prototyping, I was extensively using [keycard] as a manual for verified technical details, which saved me a lot of time and effort for trial-and-error. Keycard is also the reason that I know JavaCard is the ancient technology behind many card-based hardware crypto wallets. ðŸ«¡
